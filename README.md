# GHFollowers-repo

This is a project from Sean Allen's "Take Home Project for an iOS Dev job interview". While most of the project is Sean's design, stayed tuned for my own customizations including:

- Allowing the user to favorite from the UserInfoVC 
- Adding a custom message to empty state when search returns no results
- Allow user to see the profile of the favorited user.

## Bugs

-  In search bar, type “D”, filters to 20, but then when hit the bottom, pulls in the next 100 which do not conform to filter of “D”.
